# 🌊 Ripple – A Peer Support Web Platform for Students

**Ripple** is a full-stack web application designed to foster emotional well-being and peer support among students. Many students face stress, loneliness, or academic pressure but hesitate to reach out due to fear of judgment or lack of access to professional help. Ripple offers a safe, anonymous space where words can heal — one ripple at a time.
