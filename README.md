# ðŸŒŠ Ripple - A Peer Support Web Platform for Students

## Goal
To build a full-stack web application designed to foster emotional well-being and peer support among students. Many students face stress, loneliness, or academic pressure but hesitate to reach out due to fear of judgment or lack of access to professional help. Ripple offers a safe, anonymous space where words can heal â€” one ripple at a time.

## Features

* **Anonymous Posting System:** Users can share their thoughts and feelings without revealing their identity.
* **Peer-to-Peer Support:** Students can offer and receive encouragement, advice, and understanding from their peers.
* **Discussion Threads:** Engage in organized conversations on specific topics or challenges.
* **Visual Activism Walls:** A creative space for users to express solidarity and raise awareness.
* **User Authentication (Planned):** Secure signup, login, and profile management for accessing personalized features.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Future consideration: React/Vue/Angular)
* **Database:** (Will decide later, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS version recommended) and npm (Node Package Manager)
* Git

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Bhavya10101/Ripple.git](https://github.com/Bhavya10101/Ripple.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Ripple
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate into the backend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    (Keep this terminal window open while working on the frontend)

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate into the frontend folder (in a new terminal tab/window):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    (You can simply double-click `frontend/index.html` in your file explorer, or drag it into your browser.)

### Usage
Once both the backend server is running and the frontend `index.html` is open in your browser, click the "Test Backend" button on the webpage. You should see a response from your backend!
